    # command: rails db:setup
    command: ".ebextensions/scripts/rails_db_setup.sh"

    # From the official AWS documentation:
    #
    # You can use leader_only to only run the command on a single
    # instance, or configure a test to only run the command when a test
    # command evaluates to true. Leader-only container commands are only
    # executed during environment creation and deployments, while other
    # commands and server customization operations are performed every
    # time an instance is provisioned or updated. Leader-only container
    # commands are not executed due to launch configuration changes,
    # such as a change in the AMI Id or instance type.
    #
